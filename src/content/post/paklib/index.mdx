## What is paklib?
Paklib is a tool to extract/compile the pak file format used in the MX vs ATX Unleased and Disney Pixar Cars video games made by Rainbow Studios. I made the tool because an already existing tool called [Rainbow-Studios-PAK-Tool](https://github.com/The-Meth0d/Rainbow-Studios-PAK-Tool) didn't properly compile directories into pak files.

## How chatgpt helped
This project was the first time I ever dove into the world of reverse engineering, and the first time I opened a hex editor. That is why chatgpt helped with this project tremendously. The archive file's structure looked something like this:
```
// ARCHIVE HEADER
  4 - Number Of Files

// DIRECTORY
  // for each file
    100 - Filename (null terminated, filled with byte 204)
    4 - File Offset (relative to the start of the file data)
    4 - File Length

// FILE DATA
  // for each file
    X - File Data
```
After an issue where chatgpt thought a file was a folder, the code *almost* worked first try.
The only issue was that the file sorting was odd, to say the least.
Everytime I progressed in the sorting function, some other issue would come up.
So eventually I decided to write the sorting function myself, after chatgpt couldn't understand the sorting part.
```py
def custom_key(path):
        priority_chars = [
            ".",
            "0",
            "1",
            "2",
            "3",
            "4",
            "5",
            "6",
            "7",
            "8",
            "9",
            "\\",
            "-",
            "_",
        ]
        default_priority = 1000

        def get_priority(char):
            if char in priority_chars:
                return priority_chars.index(char)
            return default_priority + ord(char)

        return [get_priority(char) for char in path[0].lower()]

sorted_file_list = sorted(file_list, key=custom_key)
```
Although, I still find it impressive that chatgpt could understand these parameters and create the "compiler" second try.

## Whats next for paklib?
The library/tool isn't very complete or fast, so I was thinking of rewriting paklib in rust, nim, or go for a large speedup.
I was also thinking of forking The_Meth0ds tool and adding the compile functionality to it.
I am thoroughly impressed with the performance of chatgpt and understanding the project.
