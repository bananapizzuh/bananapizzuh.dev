			Hey! I am Jay, and I'm currently in the process of learning how to code. I have always been
			interested in computers since my first interaction with my family IMac. A couple years ago I
			started to learn python for fun, during freetime in school. Now, I have a couple of projects
			under my belt, and I plan on majoring in CS in college.
